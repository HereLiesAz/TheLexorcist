# Proposal: Implementing Real Generative AI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a concrete plan to implement real generative AI functionality within the application, as per your request. The approach is based on the dual-authentication method discovered in the `Geministrator` repository, providing a robust and professional solution.

## 2. The Core Concept: A Kotlin Bridge

The AI logic will not live in the Javascript scripts themselves. Instead, we will build a "bridge" in the app's native Kotlin code. This approach has several advantages:
*   **Security:** API keys and credentials are never exposed to the sandboxed Javascript environment.
*   **Power:** We can leverage native Android libraries for robust networking and authentication.
*   **Simplicity:** The Javascript scripts will only need to call a single, powerful function (e.g., `AI.generate(prompt)`) without worrying about the complex implementation details.

## 3. Phase 1: Kotlin Backend Implementation

The first phase involves modifying the app's core Kotlin code to create the AI service.

*   **Step 1: Add Dependencies.** I will add the Google AI for Android client library to the `app/build.gradle.kts` file.
*   **Step 2: Create `GenerativeAIService.kt`.** This new Kotlin service will be responsible for all AI communication. It will:
    *   Initialize the Google AI client (`GenerativeModel`).
    *   Handle authentication. It will first attempt to use Application Default Credentials (ADC), the "no-key" method. If ADC fails, it will fall back to using an API key, which it will read from a secure location.
    *   Contain a primary function: `suspend fun generateContent(prompt: String): String`.
*   **Step 3: Modify the Script Runner.** I will update `ScriptRunner.kt` to expose the `generateContent` function to the Javascript environment. From the script's perspective, it will appear as a simple-to-use function: `AI.generate(prompt)`.

## 4. Phase 2: Update the Javascript Addons

Once the Kotlin bridge is built and functional, I will perform the final rewrite of the script library.

*   **Step 1: Read `SCRIPT_EXAMPLES.md`.** I will read the curated list of scripts.
*   **Step 2: Replace Heuristics with Real AI Calls.** For every script that currently uses a self-contained "heuristic" (like the sentiment analyzer or summarizer), I will rewrite it to use the new, powerful `AI.generate(prompt)` function. This will involve crafting effective prompts to achieve the desired behavior.
*   **Step 3: Overwrite the `SCRIPT_EXAMPLES.md` file.** I will save the final, fully functional scripts to the markdown file.

## 5. Conclusion

This two-phase plan will deliver the powerful, real AI functionality you requested in a secure and robust manner. It correctly separates the native backend logic from the user-facing scripts.

I am ready to begin this implementation upon your approval.
