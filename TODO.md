# The Lexorcist - Comprehensive To-Do List

This document outlines the required tasks to develop The Lexorcist into a functional and clearly-defined legal evidence management tool. It is divided into two main parts: addressing the app's unclear purpose and tackling dysfunctional or incomplete features.

---

### **Part 1: Address Unclear Purpose & Refocus on Legal Evidence**

The most significant issue is the disconnect between the app's stated purpose as a "legal evidence tracker" and the heavy emphasis on financial tracking in its documentation and feature planning.

- [ ] **1.1. Revise `README.md`:**
    - Rewrite the `README.md` to use general legal evidence terminology. Replace financial terms (e.g., "receipts", "vendors", "amounts") with broader terms like "documents," "exhibits," "artifacts," "photos," etc.
    - The features should be described in a way that reflects this broader scope (e.g., "OCR for text-based evidence" instead of for "financial documents").

- [ ] **1.2. Align Planning Documents (`TODO.md`, `FUTURE_PLANS.md`):**
    - Rephrase or replace financially-focused tasks.
    - **Action:** Change "Expense Categorization" to "**Evidence Categorization**".
    - **Action:** Re-evaluate "Financial Analysis for Legal Cases" and consider a more general "**Timeline & Connection Analysis**" feature.

- [ ] **1.3. Audit Codebase for Terminology:**
    - Perform a full audit of the source code (comments, variable names, UI strings) to ensure consistent, non-financial terminology is used.
    - **Action:** Generalize `DataParser.kt` to extract entities relevant to legal documents (names, dates, locations) rather than just "total" and "vendor."

### **Part 2: Address Dysfunctional and Incomplete Features**

The project is in a very early stage, with many critical features missing or non-functional.

#### **Critical ðŸŽ¯**

- [ ] **2.1. Implement Core Backend:**
    - **Define Data Models:** The `model` directory is empty. Define the core data models for `Case`, `Evidence` (with fields for type, date, description, tags, etc.), and other necessary entities.
    - **Implement Database:** The `db` directory is empty. Implement a Room database to provide offline storage for all data. This addresses the "Implement Offline Support" goal.

- [ ] **2.2. Implement Core Feature Logic:**
    - **Data Parsing:** The `DataParser.kt` is unused. Implement the logic to parse text extracted by the OCR. This is a critical missing feature.
    - **Spreadsheet Parsing:** The `parseSpreadsheetFile` function in `MainViewModel.kt` is a stub. Implement it to handle `.xls` and `.xlsx` files, mapping columns to evidence fields.

- [ ] **2.3. Build Out Placeholder UI Screens:**
    - **Timeline Screen:** Implement the UI and logic to visualize evidence in a chronological timeline.
    - **Visualization Screen:** Implement the UI and logic for data visualization.
    - **Script Editor Screen:** Implement the UI and functionality for the script editor.

- [ ] **2.4. User-Friendly Error Handling:**
    - Implement specific, user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios (e.g., OCR failure, file read errors, network issues).

#### **High Priority ðŸš€**

- [ ] **2.5. Refactor and Improve Code Quality:**
    - **Refactor `MainViewModel`:** Break down the monolithic `MainViewModel` into smaller, focused ViewModels (`CaseViewModel`, `EvidenceViewModel`, `OcrViewModel`, etc.).
    - **Move API Calls:** Move Google API calls into a dedicated repository layer.

- [ ] **2.6. Improve OCR Accuracy and Options:**
    - Research and implement advanced ML Kit options (e.g., different recognizer options, language hints).
    - Enhance image preprocessing with techniques like noise reduction, skew correction, or allowing user cropping before processing.

- [ ] **2.7. Add Tests:**
    - The project lacks tests. Add unit and integration tests for ViewModels, data parsing, and database operations.

#### **Medium Priority âœ¨**

- [ ] **2.8. UI/UX Polish:**
    - Review and refine layouts, add clearer instructions, and provide better user feedback (e.g., loading indicators).
    - Improve the `EditEvidenceDialog` in the `DataReviewScreen` to make it easier to edit multi-line content and manage tags.

- [ ] **2.9. Refactor Hardcoded Strings:**
    - Move hardcoded strings (folder names, sheet names, UI text) to `strings.xml` to improve maintainability and prepare for localization.

#### **Low Priority / Future Vision ðŸ”­**

- [ ] **3.1. Flexible Spreadsheet Schema:**
    - Consider moving the hardcoded spreadsheet schema to a configuration file or providing a way for users to map columns to data fields.

- [ ] **3.2. Cloud Sync with other Providers:**
    - To reduce reliance on Google, consider adding support for other cloud providers like Dropbox or OneDrive.

- [ ] **3.3. Collaboration Features:**
    - Allow multiple users to collaborate on a single case.

- [ ] **3.4. Advanced Reporting:**
    - Generate detailed reports and visualizations from the collected evidence.

- [ ] **3.5. AI-Powered Analysis:**
    - Use AI to analyze evidence, identify patterns, and suggest connections.

- [ ] **3.6. Multi-Platform Support:**
    - Develop a web or desktop version of the app for a more powerful evidence management experience.
