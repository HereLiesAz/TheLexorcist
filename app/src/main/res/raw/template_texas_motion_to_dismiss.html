            TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF SAID COURT:
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            COMES NOW, {{DEFENDANT_NAMES}}, Defendant in the above-entitled and numbered cause, and files this Special Exception and Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Original Petition, and would respectfully show the Court as follows:
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            I. SPECIAL EXCEPTION
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            1.1. Defendant specially excepts to Plaintiff's Original Petition because it fails to state a cause of action for which relief can be granted. The allegations in the petition are vague, ambiguous, and conclusory, and fail to give fair notice of the claims being asserted.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            II. MOTION TO DISMISS
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            2.1. Based on the foregoing Special Exception, Defendant moves to dismiss this action pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 91a.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            III. PRAYER

        <div class="paragraph">
            WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, Defendant prays that the Court sustain its Special Exception, grant its Motion to Dismiss, and dismiss Plaintiff's case with prejudice. Defendant further prays for costs of court and for such other and further relief as Defendant may be entitled in law or in equity.
