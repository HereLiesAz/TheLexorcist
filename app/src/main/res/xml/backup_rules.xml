    This file defines the rules for Android's Auto Backup feature.
    The app uses a "local-first" approach, storing all critical user data,
    including the main spreadsheet (`lexorcist_data.xlsx`), case data, raw evidence,
    and user settings, on the device.

    To ensure that all user data is preserved, we will back up:
    - All shared preferences, which store user settings.
    - All files in the app's internal storage, which includes the main spreadsheet
      and all evidence files.

    <!-- Back up all shared preferences -->
    <include domain="sharedpref" path="."/>

    <!-- Back up all files in the app's internal storage -->
    <include domain="file" path="."/>
