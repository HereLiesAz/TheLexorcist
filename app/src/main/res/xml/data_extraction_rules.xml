        This file defines the rules for device-to-device transfers and
        Key/Value Backup for older Android versions.
        The app uses a "local-first" approach, storing all critical user data,
        including the main spreadsheet (`lexorcist_data.xlsx`), case data, raw evidence,
        and user settings, on the device.

        To ensure that all user data can be transferred to a new device, we will back up:
        - All shared preferences, which store user settings.
        - All files in the app's internal storage, which includes the main spreadsheet
          and all evidence files.

        <!-- Back up all files in the app's internal storage -->
