# Future Plans

This document outlines the long-term vision for the Lexorcist application. These are features and enhancements that can be considered after the items in the `TODO.md` file have been addressed.
- 
- **ML-based Evidence Categorization:** Use machine learning to automatically categorize financial documents based on their content, helping to identify relevant evidence more quickly.
- **Financial Analysis for Legal Cases:** Introduce features for analyzing financial data in the context of a legal case, such as identifying patterns, flagging suspicious transactions, and generating summary reports.
- **Evidence Tagging and Notes:** Add the ability to tag evidence with relevant keywords (e.g., "disputed," "fraudulent") and add notes for context.
- **Secure, Auditable Export:** Provide a feature to export evidence in a secure, auditable format (e.g., a signed PDF with a chain of custody report) for use in legal proceedings.
- **Web Application:** Develop a web-based version of the app that syncs with the mobile app. This would provide a more powerful interface for managing and analyzing evidence, especially for large cases.
- **Integration with Legal Software:** Explore integrations with popular legal practice management software to streamline workflows.
