# Future Plans

This document outlines the long-term vision for the Lexorcist application. These are features and enhancements that can be considered after the items in the `TODO.md` file have been addressed.

## Core Functionality Enhancements
- **Cloud Sync:** Implement a cloud synchronization feature to allow users to back up their data and access it from multiple devices. This would likely involve a backend server and user authentication.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Add the ability to handle expenses in different currencies, with automatic conversion to a user-defined base currency.
- **Budgeting and Financial Planning:** Introduce features that allow users to set budgets, track their spending against those budgets, and receive insights into their financial health.

## Platform Expansion
- **Web Application:** Develop a web-based version of the app that syncs with the mobile app. This would provide users with a more powerful interface for managing and analyzing their data.
- **iOS Version:** Create a version of the app for iOS to reach a wider audience.

## Advanced Features
- **Machine Learning-based Categorization:** Use machine learning to automatically categorize expenses based on the vendor or other information from the receipt.
- **Integration with Financial Institutions:** Allow users to link their bank accounts or credit cards to automatically import transactions.
- **Recurring Expenses:** Add a feature to manage recurring expenses, such as monthly subscriptions or bills.

## Monetization
- **Freemium Model:** Offer a free version of the app with basic features, and a premium version with advanced features like cloud sync, unlimited receipt scans, and advanced reporting.
- **Subscription Service:** A monthly or yearly subscription could be charged for the premium features.
