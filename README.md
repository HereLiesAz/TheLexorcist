# The Lexorcist

The Lexorcist is a powerful, user-friendly Android application designed to assist users in preparing for legal cases, particularly those involving the review and organization of extensive digital evidence. It provides a suite of tools to streamline the process of handling, annotating, and presenting evidence, making it an indispensable asset for legal professionals and individuals representing themselves.

## Current Status

This project is in an early development stage. Many of the features listed below are either partially implemented or planned for the future. The backend is currently based on Google Sheets, and a transition to a local Room database is planned. The application's focus is being shifted from financial document tracking to a more general-purpose legal evidence management tool.

The timeline view has been implemented using JetLime, and the overall UI has been updated to comply with the Material 3 Expressive design system guidelines.
