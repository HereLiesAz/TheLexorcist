# Agent Instructions

This file contains instructions for AI agents working on this codebase.

### Before you begin...

Analyze this project to understand it. It is an app for digitally importing, maintaining, visualizing, and tracking legal evidence. 
Make sure you read all documentation first, and do not change anything without me explicitly telling you to. 
Commit your changes after each step. 
Do NOT bother getting the app to compile unless I tell you to do so.

## Design
This app uses Jetpack Compose for UI development. 
Aside from the AzNavRail, all elements should be horizontally aligned right and vertically aligned center.
The color scheme is designed to use a random seed color to generate the color palette using the Material 3 Theme Builder.
Buttons should be outlined with no fill.
Use the experimental Material 3 Expressive design system.

If any of these things are found to not be so, inform the user and correct the issue. 

## Documentation

It is crucial to keep the documentation up-to-date with any code changes. When you modify any part of the source code, you **must** also update the corresponding documentation.

### KDoc
All public classes, methods, and properties should have clear and concise KDoc comments. The documentation should explain the purpose of the code, its parameters, and its return values.

### Markdown Documentation
The `README.md`, `FUTURE_PLANS.md`, and `TODO.md` files should be kept up-to-date with the project's status, goals, and features.
