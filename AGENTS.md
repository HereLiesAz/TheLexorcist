## Documentation

It is crucial to keep the documentation up-to-date with any code changes. When you modify any part of the source code, you **must** also update the corresponding documentation.

### KDoc
All public classes, methods, and properties should have clear and concise KDoc comments. The documentation should explain the purpose of the code, its parameters, and its return values.

### Markdown Documentation
The `README.md`, `FUTURE_PLANS.md`, and `TODO.md` files should be kept up-to-date with the project's status, goals, and features.
