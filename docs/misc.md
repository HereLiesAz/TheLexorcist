## Work Log

*   **Session: 2025-09-28**
    *   **Task:** Complete two random items from `TODO.md`.
    *   **Item 10: Allegations Screen Layout:** Verified that the layout of `app/src/main/java/com/hereliesaz/lexorcist/ui/AllegationsScreen.kt` already matched the requirements specified in the documentation. No code changes were necessary.
    *   **Item 17: Review Screen Initial UI:** The `ReviewScreen.kt` component already existed. Replaced the incorrect buttons ("Generate", "Package", "Report") with the specified buttons ("Automatic Cleanup", "Paperwork", "Finalize"). Added new string resources (`automatic_cleanup`, `paperwork`, `finalize`) to `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` to support this change.
    *   **Documentation:** Updated `TODO.md` to mark both items as `[COMPLETED]` and added notes detailing the work performed.
