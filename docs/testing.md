# Testing Instructions

This document outlines the guidelines for running tests in this project.

---

## General Policy

-   **Do Not Test Unprompted:** Do not run any tests without being explicitly told to do so by the user or as part of a pre-defined, approved plan.
-   **Purpose:** The goal is to maintain development velocity and avoid unnecessary builds. Trust in code analysis and targeted reviews to ensure quality before resorting to running a full test suite.
-   **Confidence Over Automation:** Prioritize a deep understanding of the code and the impact of your changes. A test run should be for final verification, not for initial debugging or exploration.
